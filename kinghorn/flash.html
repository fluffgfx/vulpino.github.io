<h1>Flash</h1>
<h2>Don't use flash.</h2>
<p class="flow-text">For over six years, flash has been considered a "dead software." Although still installed in many browsers, few websites continue to utilize it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/html5">Youtube has moved to an HTML5 player</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Apple has publically condemned flash and uses it on none of its products</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">and microsoft has deprecated its FlashAlike, Silverlight, for - you guessed it - HTML5.</a> Even Adobe itself is slowly ending support for adobe flash - <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">in 2011, it ditched support for mobile devices</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2012/02/adobe-and-google-partnering-for-flash-player-on-linux.html">in 2012, it ended support for linux operating systems</a>.</p>
<p class="flow-text">Why teach flash? It's outdated, unsupported, and ultimately useless to students. Flash EOL (End of Life) is viewed not as an "if" but "when" at this point in time. It's buggy, it's insecure, and it's incredibly slow compared to modern technologies.</p>
<p class="flow-text">I come to school to gain an education on items I might use in the future - even if I disagree on the importance of items, it is clear that in the future I will need all of these items to pass my college courses, at the very least. Adobe Flash does not even fall under this requirement - no class I take in college will require knowledge of Adobe Flash. By the time I go to college, Adobe Flash will probably be deprecated in favor of HTML5.</p>
<p class="flow-text">I will not go into the specifics of this assignment and my disagreement with its content - because if I were learning something of value, it would not matter. But Adobe Flash is a needlessly complex program to learn without any benefit to my future.</p>
