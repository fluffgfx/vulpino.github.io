<p class="flow-text">When I entered McFatter in the 9th grade, my mind was set on one program and that program only - Computer Programming, the career I still plan to enter and the career which continues to grab my attention and consume my free time.</p>
<p class="flow-text">But as time passed I began to see flaws in the program - I listened to the user reviews, so to speak. Even as I created such programs as <a href="https://github.com/sudo-bash/haunt">Haunt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vulpino/n3ko">n3ko</a> I began to feel uneasy with what the program offered and what I could really learn within the program. So I searched for alternatives.</p>
<p class="flow-text">One classroom stood out to me above the rest - Digital Media and Multimedia Design, a name composed entirely of buzzwords hiding a program incredibly useful to future endeavors. I once read a paper urging programmers not to always focus on the singular task of programming, but rather to grow sideways - to learn other useful tools in the trade - so as to be a better potential hire for future employers.</p>
<p class="flow-text">This is what DMMD offered - a chance to learn the Adobe suite of products, incredibly useful not exactly in the role of Programming or Software Engineering but in growing as a whole person in my knowledge of technology - not being laser focused on one skill that, perhaps, was already mostly learned.</p>
<p class="flow-text">This is not the only reason I chose the course - the teacher appeared to me infinitely more driven and willing to teach, and the students did not seem obligated to spend their free time ragging on the poor quality on the course as if to act as the guardian on the bridge, begging you to turn back even as he is devoured by lions. While my fate may not have been as grisly, it's possible it might have been even more costly to my education - so I heeded his warning and took the road less traveled.</p>
<p class="flow-text">(Although - I hear the program is popular this year. I eagerly anticipate meeting my classmates and I look forward to the next two years.)</p>
